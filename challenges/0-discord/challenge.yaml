  Welcome back to HTM!

  This year's CTF is full of mystery, intrigue and surprises... eh, not
  really, it's just meant to be a bit fun!

  But, I have heard whispers that there's a bot on the discord server who's
  giving out flags... Seems quite dodgy to me, who'd be crazy enough to do
  something like that?
flags:
  - HTM{C0M3_1_c0m3_4ll}
points: 10
deploy:
  docker: yes
  env:
    - DISCORD_TOKEN
