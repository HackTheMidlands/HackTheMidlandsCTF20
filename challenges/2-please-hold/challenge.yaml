  Down the rabbit hole! I think this is bigger than we thought!
  
  Following on from your findings, I've come across this really interesting
  contact form - but it seems to have some sort of powerful protections that
  stop me from actually talking to someone!

  I think if we could just find someone to talk to, we'd be able to find out
  way more about these people...
