  Looks like that bot was busy hiding bigger secrets! After digging around a
  bit more, I've come across this really interesting contact form - but it
  seems to have some sort of powerful protections that stop me from actually
  talking to someone!

  I think if we could just find someone to talk to, we'd be able to find out
  way more about these people...
