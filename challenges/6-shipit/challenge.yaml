  The final stage! If we can pull this off, we'll take the core servers!

  Have a look at this intercepted email for yourself:

  <code>
  I've just finished creating this image - can you deploy it for me please, I
  can't seem to login anymore!
  </code>

  It definitely doesn't seem to be a <em>normal</em> "image" at all, I can't
  seem to open it in anything!
