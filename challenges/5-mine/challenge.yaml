  I've managed to get some useful information from the vault you managed to
  hack:

  <code>
  Get "dig"ing! We've got lots of precious minerals sitting around... but we
  only really care about the gold!

  Try looking some of it up, using our nameserver at BLANK and using the map
  at <code>X.Y.mine</code>. Hopefully, you'll get rich!

  Because we love our new users, we'll let you in on a little secret -
  there's already some gold stashed away at (0, 0).
  </code>

  I'm at a loss...
